problem set answer---

1. space complexity O(N*M) 
    Time complexity O(N+M)


2. space complexity O(1) 
   Time complexity O(n^2)


3. space complexity O(log n) 
   Time complexity O(log n)

4. Write a program to convert an adjacency matrix to an adjacency list. Similarly, write a program to convert an adjacency list to an  adjacency matrix. 
Compare the time and space complexity of both programs. You can assume the graph is undirected and unweighted.



5. Write code to take the edge list of an undirected unweighted graph as input. 
In one program turn the edge list to its adjacency list representation.
In another program turn it to its adjacency matrix representation. 
Use this code snippet to take the graph as an input to your program:
